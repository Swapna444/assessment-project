creating a new assessment project
<b>About project</b>
This project involves building a Question Bank Management system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. The front-end handles the layout, styling, and dynamic interactions such as searching, filtering, and managing questions. The back-end (Node.js) connects to MySQL to perform CRUD operations, while the database stores question details, allowing for organization by type, difficulty, subject, category, and tags. The system enables creating, editing, deleting, and importing/exporting questions, with search and filter functionalities for efficient management.
